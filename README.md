# HowPoor.RU

HowPoor.RU operates similarly to an EVE killboard, but instead of tracking killmails it tracks wallets.  Both corporation and personal wallets are supported, and all information is made available on the site.

Much like a killboard, the site can only track wallets that it has ESI tokens for, but transactions show up on both parties' pages whether they have shared their ESI token or not.

This code repository is what is used for the primary website: https://howpoor.ru  
However, it is possible to run a local or private copy of the site if you desire.  If there is interest in running local copies, deployment information using Docker will be made available.

## Tech Stack

Python 3.5, MongoDB, and Redis are required to run this site.  Nginx and uWSGI are highly encouraged.

## Problems?  Feedback?

If you encounter any bugs or you think there are missing features please let me know [on the issues page](https://github.com/ArtificialQualia/HowPoorRU/issues).

If you wish to contribute to the project codebase, I will be accepting pull requests.

If you love the website enough that you feel compelled to donate, ISK donations are welcome to my eve character: **Demogorgon Asmodeous**
